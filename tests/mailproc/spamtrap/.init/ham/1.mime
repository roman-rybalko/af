Hello folks,

I think I misunderstood something, but I can't make ldapwhoami working.

Mu openldap server work perfectly I and all my users can connect using 
it. But whe I try to use ldapwhoami I get an error:

ldapwhoami -x -D uid=jfoucry,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com -W
Enter LDAP Password:
ldap_bind: Invalid credentials (49)

I am sure to use my LDAP password.


I try with -d1 to have debug, and I reach to right server.

What's going wrong?

Thanks in advance for your help,
regards,
Jacques
